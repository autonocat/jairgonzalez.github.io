Welcome User, Looks like you have stumbled across my github repository 
no need to fear. This is a platform for me to practice such programming 
and web development skills including languages such as Java, C, C++, HTML,
and CSS. All code will be written by myself using resources from the internet
(obviously) and classes that I will be taking. Now things may get slow at first,
but I have big plans to push forward and begin development on professional websites.
Thanks for checking me out -Jair Gonzalez April 25th, 2018
